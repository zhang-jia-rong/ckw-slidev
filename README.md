## Introduction

`ckw-slidev` is my personal presentation tool that combines the power of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with the flexibility of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It allows me to create beautiful presentations with ease. ✨

## Features

- **Interactive Presentations**: Create interactive slides with ease.
- **Markdown Support**: Write your slides in Markdown.
- **Custom Themes**: Customize the look and feel of your presentations.
- **Live Reload**: See your changes in real-time. 🔄
